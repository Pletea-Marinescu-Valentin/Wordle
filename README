This is a simple console game in which the player has to guess a five-letter word. The player has six attempts to guess the word, and after each guess, the game will tell the player how many of the letters they guessed are correct and in the correct position and how many are correct but in the wrong position. The game uses the ncurses library to display the game on the console.

This program requires the ncurses library to be installed on your system. On most Linux distributions, you can install the ncurses library by running the following command:
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev(on Ubuntu)

Once you run the program, you will be prompted to guess the word. Type your guess and hit enter. If your guess is correct, you win the game. If your guess is incorrect, you will have five more attempts to guess the word. If you run out of attempts, you lose the game.
